# Truck cleaning and disinfection, and the risk of PRRSV transmission in multi-site pig production systems: A network-epidemiological model approach 
Explore pig farm disease dynamics using data analysis, social network analysis, and an epidemiological model. Gain insights to enhance disease control strategies.
# Pig Farm Disease Spread Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains R code for analyzing and simulating the spread of infectious diseases in pig farms using the records of truck movements. The project employs data analysis, social network analysis, and an epidemiological model to understand disease transmission dynamics through pig farm truck movements.

## Key Features

- **Data Analysis:** Explore and analyze datasets, descriptive statistics, and the compute of the shortest road paths between the premises and estimate the distances travelled for movements. 
- **Social Network Analysis:** Investigate the network structure of pig farm truck movements to identify key influencers in disease spread.
- **Epidemiological Model:** Develop and simulate an epidemiological model to assess the probability of disease transmission within the pig farm network.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- RStudio 2023.06.1+524 "Mountain Hydrangea" Release (547dcf861cac0253a8abb52c135e44e02ba407a1, 2023-07-07) for windows
